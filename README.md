# radar-feedback-console
This repository contains a console-based application inspired by Ray Dalio’s "Principles", designed to help managers improve organizational decision-making and feedback culture.
The application simulates a simplified feedback and decision-tracking system inside a company. It enables managers to log decisions, record employee feedback, and later review or analyze them — promoting radical transparency and self-improvement.

Purpose
The goal of this tool is to provide a lightweight and transparent way for a manager to:
Reflect on past decisions
Record feedback about team members
Search and review logs for better understanding of patterns and outcomes

Decision Log
Add a new decision (with fields: date, component, person, importance level, description)
View all logged decisions
Search/filter decisions (by component, person, or date)
